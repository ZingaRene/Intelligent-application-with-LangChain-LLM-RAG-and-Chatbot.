# Intelligent-application-with-LangChain-LLM-RAG-and-Chatbot.

This project demonstrates in practice a series of techniques, strategies, and tools for building intelligent applications with LangChain and LLMs. I worked with RAG using data extracted from the web and in the end, I also created an AI-based chatbot specializing in car sales. To reproduce the project, it is necessary to create an API on the OpenAI platform to make use of the LLM gpt.
